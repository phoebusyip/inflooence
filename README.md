[Inflooence](https://inflooence.netlify.app/)

Web app that analyzes the most popular TikTok songs using Machine Learning. Supports user authentication and saved tracks.

## How it Works
Web scrape names and artists of top TikTok songs from a database using Python and Selenium

Use Spotify API to match songs by name/artist and generate key metrics (Acousticness, Liveness, Danceability, Loudness, Energy, Tempo)

Display these metrics in front end and data analyses, and use them as input features for developing a machine learning model

Integrate data/ML components with a front end where users can log in, save tracks, browse top songs, and discover upcoming trends based on ML analysis
